# Contributing (Team Guide)

- Follow the file responsibilities:
  - `text_stats.py`: pure logic only.
  - `io_ops.py`: prompts + guards + exceptions.
  - `main.py`: orchestration only.
- Use descriptive names (avoid single-letter variables unless conventional).
- Keep PRs small; prefer several small PRs over one huge one.
- Be kind in reviews; ask questions before demanding changes.
